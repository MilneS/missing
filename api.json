    "circumstance": "At 9:30 PM on February 10, Rene Yanez mounted his horse,La Mora, and left Darlington Stables in South San Gabriel with his white pit bull terrier, Queen. He had planned to go for a nighttime ride along the San Gabriel River. He did this often; night rides are not uncommon for an experienced horseman such as Yanez who was familiar with the area.\n\nHe vanished while on a moonlit ride along the San Gabriel River. The following day, his dog and horse returned to the stables without Rene. La Mora's saddle was askew and his blanket dripping wet. The horse's appearance prompted three days of continuous searching in the Whittier Narrows Flood Control Basin. Search dogs picked up the missing man's scent at a spot midway between the Whittier Narrows Dam and San Gabriel Boulevard, but a detailed search yielded nothing.",

They were expected to return to Germany on July 29 but their reserved seats aboard a Transworld Airways flight remained empty.\nThey were listed as missing persons by Interpol on August 14.\nOn October 26, 1996 a Park Ranger on an aerial surveillance mission spotted their van stuck in a wash at Anvil Spring Canyon, a wilderness area closed to vehicular traffic. Three of its four tires were flat. Despite extensive searches in the surrounding area no trace of the tourists -but an empty beer bottle a half-mile away matching bottles in the vehicle- was found. The search was called off on October 26 but in the following years numerous other searches, organized by private parties and search-and-rescue groups took place.\nInvestigators managed to retrace some of their steps. The foursome checked out of their Treasure Island hotel, in Nevada, room on July 22 and drove that same day to Death Valley. A cash-register receipt from the Furnace Creek Visitor Center\u0012s store indicates they bought an informational booklet on July 22, 1996. The following day, they drove toward the Panamint Mountains. They let an entry in a visitor's guest book in an abandoned mining camp in the national park, in German, it read: \"7-23-96. Conny Egbert Georg Max. We are going through the pass.\". Rimkus was probably referring to Mengel Pass on the southwest border of Death Valley National Park. The minivan then turned about a mile short of the pass and headed east along a sandy wash into Anvil Spring Canyon where it was later found.",

    "circumstance": "Egbert Rimkus, his girlfriend, Cornelia Meyer, his son Georg Weber and Meyer's son Max, disappeared from Death Valley on July 22, 1996.\nThe four had arrived from Germany in the US earlier in July and were going through California to Las Vegas in a minivan rented in Los Angeles. They were expected to return to Germany on July 29 but their reserved seats aboard a Transworld Airways flight remained empty.\nThey were listed as missing persons by Interpol on August 14.\nOn October 26, 1996 a Park Ranger on an aerial surveillance mission spotted their van stuck in a wash at Anvil Spring Canyon, a wilderness area closed to vehicular traffic. Three of its four tires were flat. Despite extensive searches in the surrounding area no trace of the tourists -but an empty beer bottle a half-mile away matching bottles in the vehicle- was found. The search was called off on October 26 but in the following years numerous other searches, organized by private parties and search-and-rescue groups took place.\nInvestigators managed to retrace some of their steps. The foursome checked out of their Treasure Island hotel, in Nevada, room on July 22 and drove that same day to Death Valley. A cash-register receipt from the Furnace Creek Visitor Center's store indicates they bought an informational booklet on July 22, 1996. The following day, they drove toward the Panamint Mountains. They let an entry in a visitor's guest book in an abandoned mining camp in the national park, in German, it read: \"7-23-96. Conny Egbert Georg Max. We are going through the pass.\". Rimkus was probably referring to Mengel Pass on the southwest border of Death Valley National Park. The minivan then turned about a mile short of the pass and headed east along a sandy wash into Anvil Spring Canyon where it was later found.",

The child's step father, Sol Salamon, is from Israel and lived on Lassen Street at the time.\nProsecutors had theorized that a suspect killed Sol Saloman after arguing with him over $20,000 Salomon had invested in the suspects car business in Reseda. They accused the suspect of going to the Salomon home to kill Elaine Salomon and the children, who knew the two men had been together that night at an auto show.\nAuthorities discovered small splatters of blood in one room of the Salomon family's residence. Some of the Salomons' passports, wallets and photos were discovered scattered along the Antelope Valley Freeway near Acton, California on October 17, 1982.\nThe suspect was arrested for the family's murders in August 1988. The evidence against him was circumstantial.\nThe case ended in two mistrials before the suspect was acquitted of any involvement in July 1992.\nHe is also a suspect in the 1982 disappearance and presumed deaths of Peter and Joan Davis of Granada Hills and Ron Adeeb of Burbank. Authorities believe all the cases stemmed from business disputes. He has never been charged in these cases due to a lack of evidence.",

Routine weekly visits to her other children in foster care abruptly stopped in this same approximate time frame.

    "circumstance": "MP is 54 years old. She was last seen on Sunday July 24, 1983 at approximately 2100 hours by a neighbor. She was leaving her residence and said she was going to Reno, Nevada. She claimed if she had any trouble with her car, she would drive it off a cliff. She appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n\nOn August 2, 1983, victims vehicle was discovered, abandoned at the Sugarloaf Trail in Shasta County. The MP had attempted to drive/climb a very steep hill and had failed. Instead of easily backing down, the driver simply abandoned the vehicle.\nWomen's clothing and purse were on the front seat. There was evidence the MP had gotten out of the vehicle, smoked three cigarettes (Benson & Hedges brand). A short distance up the hill, she sat down and smoked another. Walked another 12 feet, ate two fruit bars. At this point the tracks ended and no further evidence was located. The MP was not found and she has not been seen or heard from since.\n\nFor the next five days and extensive search of the surrounding trail area was conducted using grid searches and scent dogs with negative results, the search was suspended.\n\nThe MP was in average health and it is unlikely she could have walked the distance to get to the nearest paved road (without getting disoriented) - which was 45 minutes driving time away from where the vehicle was abandoned. Ten miles away from abandoned vehicle is \"Old Man Campground\" accessible only by dirt road.",

The witness stated that Cabugos removed a kayak from the car and headed down to Leadbetter Beach. Authorities initiated a search of the area on October 26 and located Cabugos's overturned kayak floating in the waters near Goleta Beach later in the day. Family members told investigators that Cabugos often went kayaking near Leadbetter Beach at sunset. The search was halted after additional evidence could not be located.

The park is a popular place for hiking and bike riding. Authorities believe Boone may have gone hiking at the park on the day of his disappearance. An extensive week long search of the park was conducted utilizing air support, horses, bloodhounds, off road vehicles, as well as, several Search and Resue personnel yielding negative results. Investigators believe that if Boone did in fact get lost or injured while hiking, he could not have survived long in the cold winter weather.",

The child's step father, Sol Salamon, is from Israel and lived on Lassen Street at the time.\nProsecutors had theorized that a suspect killed Sol Saloman after arguing with him over $20,000 Salomon had invested in the suspects car business in Reseda. They accused the suspect of going to the Salomon home to kill Elaine Salomon and the children, who knew the two men had been together that night at an auto show.\nAuthorities discovered small splatters of blood in one room of the Salomon family's residence. Some of the Salomons' passports, wallets and photos were discovered scattered along the Antelope Valley Freeway near Acton, California on October 17, 1982.\nThe suspect was arrested for the family's murders in August 1988. The evidence against him was circumstantial.\nThe case ended in two mistrials before the suspect was acquitted of any involvement in July 1992.\nHe is also a suspect in the 1982 disappearance and presumed deaths of Peter and Joan Davis of Granada Hills and Ron Adeeb of Burbank. Authorities believe all the cases stemmed from business disputes. He has never been charged in these cases due to a lack of evidence.",

Thompson apparently never arrived there, however.\nOn September 23, six weeks after his disappearance, Thompson's car, a light golden-brown 1986 Buick Skylark, was found disabled in the middle of the desert, four miles off Highway 177 on Phelan Pass Road, seventeen miles north of Desert Center (Riverside County). There was no sign of Thompson in the vicinity. Authorities speculate he may have camped there for the night. A campsite was found about three miles east of the vehicle. At the site authorities located a full can of beer, Thompson's knife, and an unopened pack of cigarettes. There have been multiple searches in this area.

Watkins never made it to her daughters home.\n\nHer vehicle was found two days later in the parking lot of what now is known as the Sutter Gould Medical Foundation building at 600 Coffee Road. None of her property was in the car.\n\nWatkins has 28000 dollar in cash with her when she left for San Jose. The money was from the sale of her Modesto home. She had told her banker she was going to use the money to invest in property together with a friend. Police contacted Watkins' daughter who said she knew nothing about her mothers plan to move in with her, not that she had sold her home. Several days after the car was found, the daughter received a letter from Watkins saying she was eloping to get married. Watkins' disappearance is suspicious since she gave several friends different stories as to why she was going out of town. Watkins worked as a nurse at Modesto City Hospital prior to her disappearance. Foul play is suspected, possibly a victim of James Tolliver.",
